Our goal is to identify similarities between documents. We have used the Jaccard Similarity theorem,  \textit{Local-Sensitive Hashing} algorithm
 and a \textit{k-shingles} and \textit{minhash signatures} representation of documents to evaluate the effectivity of the similarity computed and the time of computation. We have introduced three different hash functions to see its differences in performance.  Also  once determined the best parameters, we will give a conclusion about the best way to indentify the more similar documents.

\section{Introduction}

Our goal is to identify similarities between documents. We say that two documents are similar if they contain a significant number of common substrings that are not too small. 

The problem of computing the similarity between two files has been studied extensively and many programs have been developed to solve it. Algorithms for the problem have numerous applications, including spelling correction systems, file comparison tools or even the study of genetic evolution.

 Existing approaces can also include a brute force approach of comparing all sub-strings of pair of documents. However, such and approach is computationally prohibitive. 

 In our case we have represented each document using a k-shingles set of strings, and implemented algorithms to calculate the Jaccard Similarity and an approximation of it using a \textit{Local-Sensitive Hashing} algorithm
 based on \textit{minhash signatures}.


 
\section{Concept of similarity} \label{similarity}
First we have to focus into the definition of similarity, when we talk about the ``Jaccard similarity'',which is calculated by looking at the relative size of their intersection. 

The Jaccard similarity, also known as Jaccard index is a statistical measure of similarity of sets. For two sets, it is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets. Mathematically,
\bigbreak
\centerline{\large $J(A,B)=\frac{\left |A\cap B  \right |}{ \left |A\cup B  \right |} = \frac{\left |A\cap B  \right |}{ \left|A\right|+\left|B\right|-\left |A\cap B  \right |} $}
\bigbreak

Calculating the similarity estimation using this approach could be solved using \textit{k} independent repetitions of the MinHash algorithm, however this would require $O(k \times |A|)$ running time. \\\medskip

Let's see an example of how the Jaccard Similarity can be calculated: \\ \\
$A = \{0,1,2,5,6\}$,\\
$B = \{0,2,3,4,5,7,9\}$ \\
$J(A,B) = |A \cap  B| / |A \cup B| = |{0,2,5}| / |{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9}| = 3/9 = 0.33$\\\medskip


The complexity of our implementation is $O(n)$. To calculate the intersection of both sets we two iterators that iterate through both sets. When an element of a set is smaller than the other we increment its iterator and when they are equal we iterate both and a counter. Finally we use the value of the counter to apply the formula. 

\begin{center}

\begin{lstlisting}
Intersection(A,B){
	result = 0; 
	auto it = A.begin(), it2 = B.begin();
	while(it!= A.end() and it2 != B.end()){
		if(*it < *it2){
			++it;
		}
		else if(*it > *it2){
			++it2;
		}
		else {
			++it;
			++it2;
			++result;
		}
	}
	return result; 
}

Jaccard(A, B){
	intersection = intersection(A,B);
	result = intersection / (A.size() + B.size() - intersection);
}

\end{lstlisting}

If we take in account the cost of building a set we should observe that for unsorted sequences our cost would be incremented to $O(n \times log(N))$.


%In the case of finding similarities in text a slightly different approach is required. First, it is important to observe that testing whether two documents are exact duplicates is easy; just comparing the two documents characther-by-character would work. However, even if the documents are not identical, they can share large portions of their text.
\section{Representation of documents}

To identify lexically similar documents we need a proper way to represent documents as sets and the most effective way is to construct from the document the set of short strings that appear within it. If we do so, even if the documents have different sizes or those sentences appear in different order we will find several common elements. In the next section we will introduce some of the approaches of shingling and its variations.

\section{\textit{k}-Shingles} \label{kShingles}

A k-shingle (or word-k-gram) is a sequence of consecutive words of size k. Intuitively, two documents A and B are similar if they share enough k-shingles. By performing union and intersection operations between the k-shingles, we can find the Jaccard similarity coefficient between A and B. 
\\
There are some variations regarding on how white space (blank, tab, newline, etc) is treated. Also there is a variation that works with a bag of shingles instead of a set to keep the number of appearences of a shingle. \medskip \\
\\
How large k should be depends on how long typical documents are and how large the set of typical characters is. For example if we pick k=4 there are $27^4=531441 $ possible k-shingles. However, the calculation can be a little bit more subtile because all the characters do not appear with equal probability. A good rule of thumb is to imagine that there are only 20 characters and estimate the number of k-shingles as $20^k$. For large documents, choice k = 9 is considered safe. 

\subsubsection{Hashing Shingles}

Instead of using substrings direcly as shingles, we can pick a hash function that maps strings of length k to some number of buckets and treat the resulting bucket number as the shingle. That process compacts our data and lets us manipulate shingles by single-word machine operations.

\section{MinHash}

A minhash function on sets is based on a permutation of the universal set. Given any such permutation, the minhash value for a set is that element of the set that appears first in the permuted order. 

This algorithm provides us with a fast approximation to the Jaccard Similarity. The concept is to condense the large sets of unique shingles into a much smaller representations called ``signatures''. We will then use these signatures to measure the similarity between document, the signature won't give us the exact similarity but we will get a close estimate (the larger the number of signatures you choose, the more accurate the estimate). In this case we define the similarity like: 
 \medskip

$$  sim(a,b) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{i=1}^{t}\left\{
1  \; \; \;  if \; \;  a_{i} = b_{i} \\
\; \; \;  or \; \; \;  0 \; \; \;   if\: \;  a_{i} \neq  b_{i} 
\}\right.  $$\medskip


To implement the idea of generating randomly permutated rows, we don’t actually generate the random numbers, since it is not feasible to do so for large datasets, e.g. For a million itemset you will have to generate a million integers …, not to mention you have to do this for each signatures that you wish to generate. One way to avoid having to generate n permutated rows is to pick n hash functions in the form of :
\medbreak
\begin{center}
$ h(x)=(ax+b)\  mod(c)$
\end{center}

Where: 
\begin{itemize}
\item x is the row numbers of your original characteristic matrix
\item a and b are any random numbers smaller or equivalent to the maximum number of x 
\item c is a prime number slightly larger than the total number of shingle sets. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Get the similarity}
\begin{lstlisting}
sim(signatureMatrix,a,b)
    float simil = 0;
    for i = 0 to signatureMatrix.size() do:
        if(signatureMatrix[i][a] == signatureMatrix[i][b]) then ++simil;
 
    return simil / signatureMatrix.size();


\end{lstlisting}

\section{Locality-Sensitive Hashing for Documents}
 This technique allows us to avoid computing the similarity of every pair of sets or their minhash signatures. If we are given signatures for the sets, we may divide them into bands, and only measure the similarity of a pair of sets if they are identical in at least one band. By choosing the size of bands appropriately, we can eliminate from consideration most of the pairs that do not meet our threshold of similarity.
 \medskip 
 
\subsection{Hash function used to hash a vector}
 \begin{lstlisting}
int hash_vec(V) {
	seed = V.size();
	for each i in V do:
		seed = seed XOR (i + 0x9e3779b9 + (seed << 6) + (seed >> 2));
		//operands << and >> are shifting left and right respectively x bits
	return seed;
}

\end{lstlisting}
 \medskip 

\subsection{Filling the characteristic matrix}
In this code we fill the characteristic matrix, that is, the matrix that holds for all documents the information about which shingles it has.
\begin{itemize}
\item characMatrix is the characterisic matrix
\item shingles is a set containing all the shingles we have in total
\item docShing is a vector of sets in which in poition i we have the set of shingles of document i. 
\end{itemize}

 
\begin{lstlisting}
fill(characMatrix, shingles,docShing){
    iterator it = shingles.begin();
    for i = 0 to characMatrix.size() do:
        shingle = *(it++);
        for j = 0 to characMatrix[0].size() do:
            if(docShing[j] contains(shingle)) then characMatrix[i][j] = 1;
            else characMatrix[i][j] = 0;
\end{lstlisting}
\medskip

\subsection{Computing the signature matrix}
To compute the signature matrix we use one of the three algorithms.
\begin{itemize}
\item modular hashing
\item multiplicative hashing
\item murmur hashing 
\end{itemize}
Albeit those are only to compute the hash to do row permutations, we follow a general schema to fill it that goes as it follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
initialize signature matrix with infinity values
for i = 0 to characterisicMatrix.size() do:
	for j = 0 to characteristicMatrix[0].size() do:
		if(characteristicMatrix[i][j] == 1) then
			for k = 0 to h do:	//h is the number of hash functions that we need
				rowPermutated <- value of hash algorithm designed for row i
				//note that we always use the same algorithm
				if(rowPermutated < signatureMatrix[k][j]) signatureMatrix[k][j] = rowPermutated;
\end{lstlisting}
\medskip


\subsection{Computing the LSH and getting the candidate pairs}
The return value of this function is a set of pairs where each pair represents a candidate to evaluate. We choose to return them as a set to avoid having to check a and b and then maybe later b and a again.
\begin{lstlisting}
LSH(signatureMatrix,r,h)
    candidats;                     
    bucket;
    for i = 0 to h adding each time r to i (i+=r) do:
        bucket.clear();
        for j = 0 to signatureMatrix[0].size() do:
            compute the row for document j;
            doc1 = hash_vec(row);
            if(bucket contains doc1)
                for l = 0 to size of the bucket that stores all documents with value doc1 
                    insert in candidats every possible pair that can be done with j and all documents that were here beforehand.
                we add j to the bucket that represents the value doc1
            else
                we create another place for rows with value doc1 and we store j there

    return candidats;

 \end{lstlisting}
\begin{large}
Function that orders a pair placing the smallest number as the first.
\end{large}

\begin{lstlisting}
parella_inc(int a, int b){
	if(a < b ) then return pair(a,b);
	else return pair(b,a);
 \end{lstlisting}
 
\section{Hashing}

Hashing is a technique for dimensionality reduction. It uses a hash function that is any function that can be used to map data ( called a key) of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size (called a hash value or hash). That hash is a sum up of everything that is in the data. You can never make it backwards from the hash to the data.

Hashing is done for indexing and locating items in databases because it is easier to find the shorter hash value than the longer string.

The hash functions that we want to use need to be: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Really fast}\\
Dimensionality reduction is often a time bottle-neck and using a fast basic hash function to implement it may improve running times significantly. 
\item \textbf{Avoid hash collisions}\\
We do not want to get the same hash using different pieces of data %(DIR ALGU DEL pidgeon hole principle)
\item \textbf{Uniform distribution}\\
The hash values are uniformly distributed.
%TODO: mirar, no estic segur de quines característiques necessitem, també he vist altres distribucions, en llop va ficar també que fossin independents

\end{itemize}

In our project we have not choosen hash cryptographic functions (i.e. sha-1 or md5) because they are too slow for our purpose.

\subsection{Modular Hashing}

In the modular hashing (also called the division method), we map a key $k$ into one of $m$ slots by taking the reminder of k divided by m. It takes the following form. 

\begin{center} $h(k) = (ak+b)\  (mod \ m))$ \end{center}

Where: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a and b are any random numbers smaller or equivalent to the maximum number of k 
\end{itemize}

When using the division method, we usually avoid certaing values of $m$. For example, $m = 2^p$ for some integer $p$, then $h(k)$ would be just the $p$-lowest-order bits of $k$. A prime value is often a good choice of $m$.

\begin{center}
\begin{large}
Pseudocode Modular Hashing
\end{large}
\end{center}

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
ModularHashing(k)
	$x \leftarrow the \ maximum \ value \ possible \ of \ k $
	$a \leftarrow random \ number \ mod\  (x) $
	$b \leftarrow random \ number \ mod\  (x) $
	$m \leftarrow a \ prime \ number \geq x $
	$value \leftarrow a \times k + b \ mod\  (m) $

\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{The source code for this section can be found in `\textit{ModularHash.cc}'.}
\bigskip

\subsection{Multiplicative Hashing}
The multiplicative method for creating hash functions operates in two steps.
Firstly, we multiply the key $k$ by a constant $A$ in the range $0<A<1$ and extract the fractional part of $kA$. Then, we multiply this value by $m$ and take the floor the result. To sum up:  

\begin{center}
 $ \lfloor m\ kA \times mod(1)  \rfloor$
\end{center}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $kA  \times mod(1)$  is the fractional part of $kA$, that is, $kA- \lfloor kA \rfloor$
\end{itemize}
An advantage of the multiplication method is that the value of m is not critical. We typically choose it to be a power of 2 ($m = 2^r$ for some integer $r$), since we can then easily implement the function on most computers.

\vspace{0.4cm}
Supposing that the word size of the machine is $w$ bits, that $k$ fits in a single word and $p$ is the number of bits that you want for the size of your hash value.

 We restrict $A$ to be a fraction of the form, where s is an integer in the range $0<s<2^w$. We first mulitply k by the w-bit integer $s = A\times 2^w$. The result is a $|2 \times w| $-bit value. The desired p-bit hash value consists of the p most significant bits of $r_0$.

	\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{graphs/MultiplicativeHashingDiagram.pdf}
	\caption{Multiplicative Hashing}
	\label{fig:MultiplicativeHashing}
\end{figure}

\bigskip

Although this method works with any value of the constant A, it works better with some values than with others. The optimal choice depends on the characteristics of the data being hashed. Donald Knuth suggest that...

$ A = (\sqrt{5} -1)/2 \simeq 0.6180339887  $

...is likely to work well. So that's why we used this value as an starting point to generate different multiplicative hash functions.

	$r \leftarrow k \times s$ 
	$r_0 \leftarrow r\ mod\  (2^w) $ 
	$value \leftarrow r_0 >> (w-p)$

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Murmur Hash}

Consists in applying some multiplications (MU) and rotations (R) to the entry bytes to obtaint the hash. It uses multiple constants which are decided to make it a good hash function by passing 2 basic tests, the Avalanche Test that evaluates how the output changes if the input is slightly modified and the statistical Chi-Squared Test. We have based the implementation of this hash function on Austin Appleby's implementation. Souce : \url{https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/}\\

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generating the data} \label{generatingData}

To generate the data for our experiments we have used the \textit{random\_ shuffle} function inside the C++ STL which rearranges the elements randomly of a vector. The function swaps the value of each element with that of some other randomly picked element. Its complexity is $O(n)$ with $n$ being  the distance between first and last minus one.\\

The algorithm we implemented to generate our data consists in traversing all the document once to generate a vector of strings containing all the words, then, as many times as permutations we want, we shuffle the vector and write the result in a document. \\

\section{Experiments}
We designed some experiments in order to test our algorithms, and discover how some of their variables affect the outcome.

\subsection{\textit{k}-shingles Size}
\textbf{The source code for this experiment can be found in `\textit{jocProvesJaccard.cc}'.}
\bigskip

We tested different sizes of $k$ for our k-shingles.
For us, $k$ defines the number of characters for each k-shingle.

Using the algorithm explained in \autoref{generatingData}, we generated 20 permutations of a 50 words document, thus obtaining 20 new documents.

Then we calculated the Jaccard Similarity (section \ref{similarity}) for all the possible pairs of documents from this set.

The number of possible pair combinations for a set of $n$ elements (where order is not important) is given by $\binom{n}{2}$.

In our case, with a set of 20 documents we have:
\bigbreak
\centerline{\large $\binom{20}{2} = 190$}
\bigbreak

So we computed the Jaccard Similarity for these 190 pairs of documents, for different sizes of $k$, ranging from 2 to 20. The results can be seen in \autoref{fig:KShinglesSimilarity}.

\bigbreak
As we expected, the similarity decreases as the size of the k-shingles increases.

For smaller values of $k$ that allow k-shingles to remain within a word, we see that a lot of similarities are found, as the documents share the same words.
On the other hand, for values of $k$ that span more than one word, the similarity between documents is very small (because the documents don't share the word order, so the probability of identical k-shingles decreases).
In fact, we observe that for values of $k$ larger 12, the similarity obtained is mostly 0.

As mentioned in \autoref{kShingles}, a good and reasonable value for $k$ is 9.
For $k = 9$, the similarity found between all our random documents is less than 0.1, which corresponds with the fact that the documents don't really share sentences or many contiguous words.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graphs/JaccardSimilarityValueKshingles.pdf} 
	\caption{Relation between the K-shingles size and the similarity (for all of the possible pairwise combinations of 20 random permutations of a 50 words document)}
	\label{fig:KShinglesSimilarity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Performance of Different Hashing Algorithms}
\textbf{The source code for this experiment can be found in `\textit{jocProvesHashTimes.cc}'.}
\bigskip

We have tested different k sizes for our k-shingles and three different hash functions in the process of filling the signature matrix to check their different performance. The process of filling the signature matrix is explained in the section 7 and our hash functions are MurmurHash3, Multiplicative Hash and Modular Hash and can be seen more deeply in the section 8.

As we expected initially, the time increases as the size of the k-shingle increases. This behaviour can be explained using the fact that the number of different shingles we would have to work with would be bigger. It is trivial to observe that the number of different k-shingles is going to have a growing tendency based on their size. 

Also we have been able to observe that the performance of MurmurHash and MultiplicativeHash are almost the same and ModularHash is the one that has performed the best, performing almost always with values smaller than the half of the others two.
